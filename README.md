# Laravel app for Azure App Service

Based on tutorial at [Build a PHP and MySQL web app in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/tutorial-php-mysql-app?pivots=platform-linux).

Taken from the official [Laravel sample task list application](https://github.com/laravel/quickstart-basic) and modified minimally to make it work with Azure App Service.
